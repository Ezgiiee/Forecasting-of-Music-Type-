## This is an example of a model made using some of the machine learning algorithms.

Finally I start the test of the models using these algorthims and calculate accuracy;
• Logistic Regression -> 29.66
• ***Random Forest Classifer -> 51.88***
• K Neighbors Classifier -> 16.63
• Support Vector Classifier -> 16.28
